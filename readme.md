# My codes

## The steps I succeeded in this project

### 1- I get the rendering the cards when click the generate button.

    - When I click the generate button I get all the recipe card with its title, picture, timming, difficulty and timing.
    - I also added a button in each card to see more about the recipe.
    - I set the button which shows the form onja cook book inside of the container. And I delete the generate button inside of the container.

### 2- I succeeded te showing more information about the recipe when click more info button in each recipe card and show it in modal.

    - I used distructuring to get the ingredient and step value.
    - Most values are from the recipes.find() apart from those which said above.

### 3- I also get the remove modal when click outside the modal

### 4- I could show the recipe form when click the add new recipe button

## The steps I haven't got made

### 1- I am still not sure if the loop of ingrendient and steps work in the way we expect.

### 2- I haven't finished the ingredient and step buttons worked to add new inputs yet

### 3- Also I haven't done the submit form yet.

If I had more time, I would have got the **ingredient, step and submit buttons** .
